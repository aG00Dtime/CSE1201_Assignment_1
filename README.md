## Tasks attempted

## Subtask 1 
"Your goal in this task is to develop a C-program that is capable of calculating Pi (π) using the Monte Carlo methodology highlighted above. The program must be able to accept an input value that dictates the number of iterations that will be used to estimate Pi, i.e., number of points to be created. As the number of iterations increases, so should the accuracy of the Pi value."
## Subtask 2
"Your goal in this task is to develop a simple C-program that accepts as input the values of ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’ of a quadratic equation in the form ax2+bx+c=0, and subsequently solves for the roots of the equation using the Completing the Square method. In addition to accepting values from the user, your program must display the steps of the solving processed inclusive of an output in the format: First root is : Second root is::"


## Subtask 4
"Create a program which allows a user to play a simple hangman game. Your program should follow the basic rules of a hangman game, which include but are not limited to:

● Arbitrarily selecting a word from a list of words stored somewhere in the program.

● Displaying each letter of the word as a blank space ( _ ) for the user to see.

● Allowing the user to guess different letters where a correct guess would replace the corresponding blank space with that letter and an incorrect guess would add one limb to a stick character on the screen.

● The user wins if they manage to guess all of the letters of a particular word (or the word itself) and would lose if the stick figure is completed before they can do so."
